        <summary>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</summary>

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
          uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
          notice.

        <p>
          California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the 'Shine The

          parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of

          writing to us using the contact information provided below.

        <h4>CCPA Privacy Notice</h4>

          The California Code of Regulations defines a 'resident' as:

          a temporary or transitory purpose and (2) every individual who is
          domiciled in the State of California who is outside the State of

        <div>
          <p>
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
            determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
            in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with information you
            have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information
            we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
            communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously
            provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
            circumstances dictate.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to
            verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
            possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
            for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
            identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
            request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
            verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
            purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
            soon as we finish verifying you.

          <p>
            Other privacy rights You may object to the processing of your
            personal information. You may request correction of your personal
            data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict
            the processing of the information. You can designate an authorised
            agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a
            request from an authorised agent that does not submit proof that
            they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf in
            accordance with the CCPA. You may request to opt out from future
            selling or sharing of your personal information to third parties.
            Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as
            soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from
            the date of the request submission. To exercise these rights, you
            can contact us or by referring to the contact details at the bottom
