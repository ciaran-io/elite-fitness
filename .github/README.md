#### 3. Competitor Analysis

- **Competitor Identification**: Direct competitors can include global online retailers such as Amazon's health/fitness
  category or Europe-based fitness e-commerce platforms like Gymshark. Indirect competitors can be local health and
  fitness stores in Ireland.
- **Competitor Strategies**: Free shipping within Europe, discounts, and coupling products with free wellness advice are
  common strategies among competitors.
- **Competitor Strengths / Weaknesses**: Amazon's vast range and fast delivery can be seen as strengths. However, a lack of personalized service and specialist focus can be potential weaknesses.

#### 4. Pricing Analysis

- **Competitor Prices**: The pricing for health and fitness products varies among retailers. For instance, the average
  price of protein supplements is about â‚¬30 for 1kg across various online platforms.
- **Cost Evaluation**: Adding operational costs, shipping, and desired profit to the base cost of goods would dictate

  offering environmentally friendly fitness gear along with organic, plant-based supplements.

  the European preference for convenience and novelty.

### SWOT Analysis

#### Strengths

1. **Wide Product Variety**: Having a broad array of products caters to different customers' needs and tastes. This
   means we can attract a larger audience, and customers can get all their needs in one place, increasing the chances of
   repeat business.

   by making shopping seamless and enjoyable. This may lead to an increase in sales, the frequency of purchases, and
   customer retention rates.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Competitive Market**: The health and fitness sector is highly saturated with many established brands. New entrants
   face stiff competition, which makes it a challenge to attract customers and ensure repeat business.
2. **Inventory Management Challenges**: Trying to maintain a wide variety of products may lead to complex inventory
   management. Tracking and managing inventory levels can become difficult, and any errors may lead to overspending on
   inventory or stockouts.

#### Opportunities

   fitness products. As more people grow conscious of their health and fitness, demand for your products can be expected
   to increase.
